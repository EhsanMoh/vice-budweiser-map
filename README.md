# vice-budweiser-map

Uses a custom version of js-store-locator library (https://github.com/f3ndot/js-store-locator) which was compiled and minified into [assets/store-locator.min.js](assets/store-locator.min.js).

Should you want to change the fundermental underpinnings of the library, you'll want to clone my fork of [js-store-locator](https://github.com/f3ndot/js-store-locator) and follow its README instructions for building/compiling and then replace the [assets/store-locator.min.js](assets/store-locator.min.js) file here with what's compiled in that one.

So far the list of modifications from Google's original source is here:
